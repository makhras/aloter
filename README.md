# Aloter

An uncalled for tool to view your position in time relative to your expected lifetime, with an interactive interface and some nice, calming circles to display units of time.


What you can do in this app:

1. Display lifetime in years, months, weeks or days.
2. Display lifetime of 60, 70, 80 or 90 years.
3. Pick date of birth in order to compare the past against the waning future. 
4. Display dimensions of grid at bottom of page.
5. Crisis on. ðŸ¥‚
